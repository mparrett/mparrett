### Hey there!

I'm Matt, a Machine Learning Platform Engineer at Sprout Social. I've worked on ML platforms at places like Mercari US and Amazon Alexa. If you're working on something interesting in ML or want to talk about where AI is headed, hit me up.

I'm a dad to two boys and our Weimaraner. When I'm not building things, I'm usually doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or getting outside here in the Pacific Northwest.

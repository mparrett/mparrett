### Hi there! 👋

I'm Matt, a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on practical solutions. At Sprout Social, I work on our ML platform. My experience includes roles at Mercari US and Alexa. If you're delving into something interesting in the ML world or just want to discuss the latest in AI, feel free to reach out! I’m always eager to connect and learn with fellow enthusiasts in the field.

🥋 On the personal side, I'm a dad to two boys and our family's Weimaraner. When I'm not in tech mode, you can find me practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or exploring the great outdoors of the Pacific Northwest.

- 👀 Trying to keep up with the insane developments with large language models
- 💞️ Let's build something great together!
